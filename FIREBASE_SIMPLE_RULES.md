# 🔥 **SIMPLE WORKING FIREBASE RULES**

## **🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX - Use These Simple Rules**

The issue is that your current rules are too complex. Here are **SIMPLE, WORKING** rules that will fix the permission errors:

### **Step 1: Go to Firebase Console**
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `linklly-9525b`
3. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**

### **Step 2: Replace ALL Rules with This SIMPLE Code**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow all authenticated users to read/write all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Publish Rules**
1. **Delete everything** in the rules editor
2. **Copy the simple rules** above
3. **Paste them** into the editor
4. **Click "Publish"**
