# 🔥 ADDITIONAL FIREBASE INDEX NEEDED

## **🚨 MISSING INDEX DETECTED**

The app is trying to fetch private posts from connections, but Firebase needs another index for this query.

## **📋 CREATE THIS ADDITIONAL INDEX:**

### **Index 3: Private Posts from Connections**
- **Collection ID**: `posts`
- **Fields**: 
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `isPublic` (Ascending) 
  - `createdAt` (Descending)
  - `__name__` (Descending)

## **🔧 STEPS TO CREATE:**

1. **Go to Firebase Console** → Firestore Database → Indexes
2. **Click "Create Index"**
3. **Fill in the details:**
   - Collection ID: `posts`
   - Fields:
     - Field: `userId`, Order: `Ascending`
     - Field: `isPublic`, Order: `Ascending`
     - Field: `createdAt`, Order: `Descending`
     - Field: `__name__`, Order: `Descending`
4. **Click "Create"**
5. **Wait for it to build** (usually 2-5 minutes)

## **🎯 WHY THIS INDEX IS NEEDED:**

The app fetches posts in two ways:
1. **Public posts** (already indexed) ✅
2. **Private posts from connections** (needs this index) ❌

This index allows the app to efficiently query:
- Posts where `userId` is in the user's connections
- AND `isPublic` is false (private posts)
- Ordered by `createdAt` (newest first)

## **✅ AFTER CREATING THIS INDEX:**

- Private posts from connections will load properly
- No more Firebase index errors
- Full post functionality will work
- Connection posts will appear in feeds

**Create this index and the app will work perfectly! 🚀**
